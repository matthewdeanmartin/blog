Summary: Learning about Github Issues, Actions and writing a Markdown build script.

All I did all weekend was Github hacking. First I invested a lot of time learning about
Github Issues and Projects. It is like Jira, but more limited. Will it convince me to stop
using a TODO.md document? Maybe.

I also reviewed all my repos, deleted junk repos and forks I don't care about. I added
all my repos to lists, e.g. "My Best Repos" so that I could find them. I noticed that
Github allows pinning repos but not lists and not gists.

I started adding Github actions to all my repos that I care about and got passing builds
on about half dozen.

I noticed many repos were text oriented, so I revived my idea of writing a build script for markdown + English.
In other words, doing the things that word-processors do, spellcheck, format, grammar check, but
doing so with the tools of software development.

I went the Reston library and got some books. Feels like old times.
