# Can a mediocre vegan runner match an omnivore professional? Part 2

Well, not yet. Here is my theory why:

- I need about 5 years of serious running to build up to it
- I'm starting around age 48-49, currently 50, so I'm doing this in difficult mode, as compared to if I'd started 
when I was 35

My marathon times to date are definitely mediocre.

Any, after a race, I do bounce back really fast, so I think the vegan-recovery advantage is a real thing, but I'm not
surrounded by enough runners to make this data based opinion.
