# Personal Productivity

## Everything markdown, including Obsidian

Unrelated to my need for a personal productivity system, I've been research everything about Markdown, particular what python libraries exist for it and what interesting things can be done with it. Obsidian is one such thing, a sort of IDE for Markdown. It isn't quite just a text editor with Markdown features, nor a wordprocessor. It is like an IDE in that it has many plug ins for manipulating Markdown for a wide range of goals and to support many personal productivity systems.

It looks promising because it seems to be a good fit for people who can't get themselves to follow a rigid order. I think I can write a lot, as long as I don't have to keep up some specific methodology for a long time. Like software development issue trackers, I can get excited about them for a while, write code in rigid parallel to my ticket activity and then the link disolves and the tickets are just a shadow of what is going on in the code I write.

I think this Obsidian thing might be able to organically adapt to the level of structure that I might feel like at any given moment.

## Plans

I want to use it for

- TODO lists.
- Notes. Maybe I can use it a place to record stuff I've read online
- Project tracking, espcially side projects

If I can write the code to make it happen:
- Import starred github projects as "TODO" items or projects
- Import bookmarked mastodon posts as "TODO" items

Using a running log as a note system is new to me. I think one strategy is to write things down everyday in the daily notes. The Notes get hyperlinks and tagged. Then by searching for tags/links you can generate a synthetic document that combines the related parts of your daily log.
