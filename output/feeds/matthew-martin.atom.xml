&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was spent hacking on ChatGPT. I almost got it to convert pymarc to golang. The key is to strip down the source code to the bare bones so that it can fit into Assistants memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried &lt;a href="https://github.com/dflook/python-minifier"&gt;python-minifier&lt;/a&gt; but that didn't really help, I think it made it worse by nearly obfuscating some code. If I can't read it, Assistant probably can't either. I think it just needs comments and docstrings stripped out. Assistant really also can only see things as one document, so if you got 10 files, it needs them merged to one, in an order than tells a story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chasing Markdown down a rabbit hole&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A while ago I tried to create a markdown build script. Markdown is such a weird thing. It is English, so it needs spellcheck, grammar check. It is a templating language so it can benefit from linting. It also an input to a lot of CMS's that all did different things to handle Markdowns limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what I made:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/matthewdeanmartin/blog/blob/main/build.sh"&gt;A build script&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/matthewdeanmartin/blog/blob/main/.pre-commit-config.yaml"&gt;A pre-commit script&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also had the pre-commit hook call the build script adn the build commit call &lt;code&gt;pre-commit run&lt;/code&gt; and wondered why it took forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And cloudflare fought with me until I wrote this script to deploy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/matthewdeanmartin/blog/blob/main/cloudflare.sh"&gt;Cloudflare pages deploy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Running&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also ran on the treadmill. With November, December, and January being an endless collage of some sort of common code, I'm still not at 100% like I was in the autumn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kids went to swimming lessons yesterday, so not a lot of activies. I'm trying to catch up on that today.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="life"></category><category term="life"></category></entry><entry><title>Hacking on the first weekend of January 2023</title><link href="http://wakayos.com/blog/what-i-did-today.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-01-08T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-01-08T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Matthew Martin</name></author><id>tag:wakayos.com,2023-01-08:/blog/what-i-did-today.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Learning about Github Issues, Actions and writing a Markdown build script.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;All I did all weekend was Github hacking. First I invested a lot of time learning about
Github Issues and Projects. It is like Jira, but more limited. Will it convince me to stop
using a &lt;code&gt;TODO.md&lt;/code&gt; document? Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also reviewed all my repos, deleted junk repos and forks I don't care about. I added
all my repos to lists, e.g. "My Best Repos" so that I could find them. I noticed that
Github allows pinning repos but not lists and not gists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started adding Github actions to all my repos that I care about and got passing builds
on about half dozen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed many repos were text oriented, so I revived my idea of writing a build script for markdown + English.
In other words, doing the things that word-processors do, spellcheck, format, grammar check, but
doing so with the tools of software development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went the Reston library and got some books. Feels like old times.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="life"></category><category term="life"></category></entry><entry><title>Does it work?</title><link href="http://wakayos.com/blog/first-post.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Matthew Martin</name></author><id>tag:wakayos.com,2022-12-31:/blog/first-post.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Does it work&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I guess it works.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="testing"></category><category term="junk"></category><category term="junky"></category><category term="trash"></category></entry></feed>
