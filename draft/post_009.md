Summary: Thinking about what to do when it is so hot.

# Personal Productivity and Heat 

I live in a town house, the temperature right now is:

- Ground-level/"basement" - 68째F with humidity of 52%
- 1st floor - 70째F
- 2nd floor - 75째F
- 3rd floor attic office - 76째F

The 10 degree difference is pretty common all year. The best floor is the basement in the summer. The rest of the
time the attic office has the best ergonomics and has the best desk setup, with a standing desk and all.

Moving the laptop around the house is not nearly as ergonomic as you'd think because away from the desk you lose out
on the 2nd monitor, shelf speakers, chair, microphone, track pad, printer, KVM switch.

## Exercise
When I run outside in the heat, it just wrecks me. I could put up with the temporary discomfort, but I feel awful for 
the rest of the day and twice I've gotten injuries during long runs where the only thing in common was that it was
hot and the run was more than 30 minutes. 

## Things to do
- Start showing every morning. It doesn't need to be an ice shower to lower body temperature.
- Stay out of rooms over 72.
- Stop running outside except when it is under 68-72 degree, which could mean for the rest of the summer. The morning 
temperatures most days are well over that.
